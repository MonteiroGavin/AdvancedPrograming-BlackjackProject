# CS 2300 Module 2 Open Ended Project Gavin Monteiro:
Blackjack: 
    My program runs the card game blackjack, with one player inputs. The player versus a dealer
and who ever's hand is closest to 21 after drawing cards, without going over, wins. This program 
uses many Module one concepts such as:
- Has-A class relationships:
  - Card and Deck. The deck class is composed of cards, therefore deck has a (or multiple) card(s).
- Is-A class relationships:
  - 
# Bugs
At the moment, no bugs are currently present. I did have to use break for some of my input validations
that could probably work without using that but I was having trouble finding a good way to do so.

# Future work
I do not have a split mechanic implemented, where the player can split their hand into two separate hands
for double the chances to win. This would be an interesting addition to the game mechanics.
There is also no betting system or win streak/score implemented that could be further developed.
Finally, more than one player implementation would be interesting to explore as well.

I think I have earned FILL IN points
- Main.cpp: 
- Testing.cpp: 
- Has-A relationships: I believe I have credit for the following relationships: Deck has Card(s) which would be 20 points. Dealer and Player both have hands which have cards(I do not know if 
since player and dealer are too similar becuase of the way they both use hand in the same way) which would be 40 points. Blackjack has a Player a Dealer and a Deck, since these 
are three has-a relationships, they are 60 points. This brings a total of 110 points (If dealer and player are counted as the same, then 100 points)
- Is-A relationships:
- File I/O:
- Style and documentation: 0 points. I think there are comments and details where needed and are throughout my program.
- Video: 0 points. I run through mulitple times and reach different ways to end the round, showing many parts of my program.
- Lifespan of project: I created the repository on Sep 23rd, well before the 7 day minimun. I have also had at least 3 days of significant work.

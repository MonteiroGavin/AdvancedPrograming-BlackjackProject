# CS 2300 Module 2 Open Ended Project Gavin Monteiro:
Blackjack: 
    My program runs the card game blackjack, with one player inputs. The player versus a dealer
and who ever's hand is closest to 21 after drawing cards, without going over, wins. This program 
uses many Module one concepts such as:
- Has-A class relationships:
  - 
- Is-A class relationships:
  - 
# Bugs
At the moment, no bugs are currently present. I did have to use break for some of my input validations
that could probably work without using that but I was having trouble finding a good way to do so.

# Future work
I do not have a split mechanic implemented, where the player can split their hand into two separate hands
for double the chances to win. This would be an interesting addition to the game mechanics.
There is also no betting system or win streak/score implemented that could be further developed.
Finally, more than one player implementation would be interesting to explore as well.

I used geeksforgeeks for my deck shuffle() function: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/shuffle-a-deck-of-cards-3/

I also got help with my enums for rank and suit from codeguru forums: https://forums.codeguru.com/showthread.php?486964-Card-and-Deck-Class-using-enum-help

# Grade

I think I have earned 160 points
- Main: 40 points, many concepts of input validation that all work accordingly.
- Classes: 20 points each for Card, Deck, Player, Dealer, and Blackjack totalling 100 points. All of these are either in the main program 
or are in other classes within the main program.
- Overloaded operator, enums: My card Rank and Suit are implemented throughout my program and the overloaded print is used often as well.
- Style and documentation: 0 points. I think there are comments and details where needed and are throughout my program.
- Video: 0 points. I run through mulitple times and reach different ways to end the round, showing many parts of my program. And input validation is demonstrated.
- Lifespan of project: I created the repository on Aug 28th, well before the 7 day minimun. I have also had at least 3 days of significant work.
